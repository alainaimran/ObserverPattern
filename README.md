# ObserverPattern

Java Project - Observer Pattern Example

Overview:

This project is a Java-based implementation showcasing the use of object-oriented programming concepts and design patterns. The main focus is on demonstrating the Observer Pattern and how it can be used to handle events or changes in state within a system.

Project Purpose:

The goal of this project is to help students and developers understand how to structure and implement the Observer Pattern in a clean and modular way. It also demonstrates how to build reusable components and manage communication between objects.

Key Features:

- Use of interfaces and abstract classes for extensibility
- Implementation of the Observer Design Pattern
- Dynamic subscription and unsubscription of observers
- Custom event handling with real-world examples
- Clear separation of logic for maintainability

Folder Structure:

- source/
  - Main classes
  - Interfaces
  - Observer implementations
  - Demo classes to run and test the code


Customization:

You can add more observer types, customize event messages, or integrate the observer pattern with other systems like file watchers, UI elements, or APIs.

Learning Outcomes:

- Understanding how to implement and use the Observer Pattern
- Learning the benefits of decoupling components in software design
- Improving skills in interface-based programming and modular design
